# iOS/Android App Update Rules

This repository hosts a **static JSON file** (`update-rules.json`) used to manage **forced** and **optional** updates for an iOS/Android application already published on the App Store.

The JSON file provides:
- **Minimum supported version** â†’ anything below this triggers a *forced update*.
- **Latest version** â†’ anything below this (but above min supported) triggers an *optional update*.
- **Custom messages** for forced/optional popups.
- **Version history log** for displaying "What's New" in update prompts.
- **Store country code** for App Store lookup.
